h2. Call to Action

* All calls to action (or CTA: e.g. Sign Up, Read Stories) should start with a verb.
** Instead of showing a button as [Stories], show it as [Read Stories]
** Instead of [New Question], show it as [Ask a New Question]

* In some instances there might be multiple actions. Try to choose a verb that accompanies all the possible actions. 
** For example, a CTA to the Stories section would be Read Stories, rather than Publish a Story. Similarly, a CTA to the Q&A section would be Browse Questions, instead of Ask Questions, since asking (or answering questions) is only a small subset of things a users can do, and might lead users to think there's only one possible action.
